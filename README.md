# Excel Data Analysis

## Crowdfunding Analysis with Excel

## BACKGROUND
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

## Tools and Techniques Used
**Microsoft Excel**:
- Conditional Formatting: Used to highlight trends, outliers, and key data points for easier interpretation.
* Pivot Charts: Utilized to summarize and visualize large datasets, enabling easy exploration of data patterns.
- Line Graphs: Created to show trends over time and highlight changes in the data.
* Statistical Analysis: Conducted basic statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation) to summarize the data and draw meaningful conclusions.
* GitHub

**Sheet 1** used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. Used conditional formatting to reorganize worksheet for better analysis. **Chart 1** created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.Created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on that table.**Chart 2** Created a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.Created a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on that table.**Sheet 3** Created a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years.Created a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.**Goal Analysis** Created new table analyizing success and failures within goal range categories.**Statistical Analysis** Used Mean, Medium, Variance and Standard deviation to evaluate successful and unsuccessful campaigns.**Written Report** Made conculsions from dataset, went over limitations and made suggestions for additionaltables and graphs.
